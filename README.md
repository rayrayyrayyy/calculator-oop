# About the program
a python program that serves as a simple calculator that can perform four mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 
It's like my previous calculator program but this time it is object oriented and without GUI.

## Procedural
- class_and_functions.py has the functions to perform the four operations
- intro_outro.py has the welcoming message and the outro message
- main.py is the main program that should be run
